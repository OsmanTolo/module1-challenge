# Module 1 Challenge - SEO Optimization Website

## Description

This repo contains my solution to the Module 1 - Code Refactor Challenge of Trilogy Skills Front-End Development Boot Camp. The project provide evidence of my ability to identify and solve web accessibility issues that are often overlooked by new web deveoper students.

This is demonstrated by taking an existing website code with various accessibility issues, and refactoring it to follow accessibility standards such as [Semantic HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) with concise CSS selectors.

## Usage
