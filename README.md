# Module 1 Challenge - SEO Optimization Website

## Description

This repo contains my solution to the Module 1 - Code Refactor Challenge of Trilogy Skills Front-End Development Boot Camp. The project provide evidence of my ability to identify and solve web accessibility issues that are often overlooked by new web deveoper students.

This is demonstrated by taking an existing website codebase with various accessibility issues, and refactoring it to follow accessibility standards such as [Semantic HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) with concise CSS selectors, so that the site is optimized for search engines.

In doing so:

- Semantic HTML elements can be found throoughtout the source code.
- All HTML elements follow a logical structure indepedent of their styling and positioning.
- All th eimages and icons contain accesibile [alt](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_alt.asp) attricutes to provide alternative information if a user cannot view it on the website, due to slow connection, or an error in the image/icon location, or if the user uses a screen reader.

* The heading attributes fall in sequential order.
* Title elements are concise and descriptive.

## Usage
